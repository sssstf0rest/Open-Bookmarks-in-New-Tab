# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Chrome extension (Manifest V3, v2.3.0) that opens bookmarks in a new tab without navigating the current page. There is no bookmark-click event in the Chrome APIs, so the extension rewrites bookmark URLs with a marker, intercepts the resulting navigation, and opens the real URL itself.

## Branch Topology — read this first

`main-branch-folk` is a fork of `main` with identical history (currently v2.3.0, `newtab@` + `empty.zip` architecture). Two architectures exist in this repo, and mixing them up is the most likely way to get lost:

| Branch | Version | Marker | Cancellation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main`, `main-branch-folk` (this one) | 2.3.0 | `newtab@` userinfo + GitHub Pages proxy for some domains | dummy `empty.zip` download, cancelled |
| `codex/fix-chrome-usage-issues`, `aug-bug-fix` | 2.4–2.5.0 | trailing `?<runtime-id>=…` query param | service-worker-generated typed HTTP 204 (`cancel.html`), no download at all |

`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md` at the repo root describe the **query-marker rewrite**, not the code on this branch. Treat them as a research log and design rationale (they record Chrome-151 experiments comparing DNR block, extension-page redirect, `window.stop()`, and 204 cancellation), not as documentation of the current source. Same for any `js/url-utils.js` or `tests/` references — those exist only on `aug-bug-fix`.

## Development

No build step and no test suite on this branch — plain HTML/CSS/JS loaded directly by Chrome.

1. `chrome://extensions/` → enable Developer mode
2. **Load unpacked** → select this folder
3. After editing, click the refresh icon on the extension card. Reloading re-runs `init()` but not `onInstalled`, so bookmark re-prefixing does not happen on reload — toggle the extension off/on in the popup to force a full rewrite.
4. Service-worker logs (`[Bookmarks→NewTab] …`) appear under the "service worker" link on the extension card, not the page console.

Verifying changes means watching real bookmark clicks: check that exactly one destination tab opens, that the source tab is untouched, and that no download appears in `chrome://downloads`.

## Interception Chain

Three listeners race on every bookmark click; understanding their ordering is essential:

1. **`webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate`** ([js/background.js:516](js/background.js:516)) — the **primary** path. Fires before the declarativeNetRequest redirect, so it opens the destination tab immediately rather than waiting for the download round-trip. It records `details.tabId` in `handledTabs` **synchronously before any `await`**, so the other two listeners can see the entry. Do not move that `set` below an await.
2. **`downloads.onCreated`** ([js/background.js:557](js/background.js:557)) — safety net. The DNR rule ([rules.json](rules.json)) redirects `^https?://newtab@` main-frame requests to the bundled `empty.zip`, producing a dummy download that this listener cancels and erases. It also opens the tab as a fallback if `onBeforeNavigate` never fired. **It has no tab identity** (`DownloadItem` carries none), so it correlates on the destination URL via `recentlyOpenedUrls` and, when it does fall back, calls `openInNewTab` with no tab id so a new tab is created rather than an existing one guessed at.
3. **`webNavigation.onCommitted`** ([js/background.js:639](js/background.js:639)) — restore path. Handles the two cases where the source tab actually navigated: the prefix survived to commit (Edge, timing), or Chrome stripped the prefix before DNR could match. Restores the tab with `tabs.goBack()`, falling back to `tabs.remove()`, then to `chrome://newtab`.

### Two handoff maps — `handledTabs` and `recentlyOpenedUrls`

The three listeners share state through two maps, both written **synchronously in `onBeforeNavigate` before any `await`** and both expiring after `HANDOFF_TTL_MS` (10s):

- **`handledTabs`** (`Map<tabId, {cleanUrl, reused}>`) — read by `onCommitted`, which knows the tab id.
- **`recentlyOpenedUrls`** (`Map<cleanUrl, timestamp>`) — read by `downloads.onCreated`, which does **not** know the tab id and never can. `DownloadItem` has no `tabId` field, so the URL is the only thing both listeners can see. The download listener extracts `cleanUrl` *before* `cancel`/`erase` so its dedup decision reflects state as of `onBeforeNavigate`, not several IPC hops later.

Keying the download path on `tabId` is what produced duplicate tabs on every click; don't reintroduce it.

### `handledTabs` and the `reused` flag

`handledTabs` (`Map<tabId, {cleanUrl, reused}>`, [js/background.js:108](js/background.js:108)) is the deduplication state, cleared after 10s. `reused: true` means `openInNewTab` navigated the **source** tab directly because it was an empty/new-tab page ([`isReusableBlankTab`](js/background.js:330)). When `reused` is set, `onCommitted` must **not** restore the tab — the commit is the intended destination, and its final URL may legitimately differ from `cleanUrl` after server-side redirects (`chat.openai.com` → `chatgpt.com`, `baidu.com` → `www.baidu.com`). Breaking this check makes destination tabs close themselves.

## Credential-Stripped Domains

Chrome's network stack silently strips the `newtab@` userinfo on certain high-security domains before DNR sees the request, so the rule never matches. `CREDENTIAL_STRIPPED_DOMAINS` ([js/background.js:73](js/background.js:73) — Gmail, Outlook, Baidu) routes those bookmarks through a GitHub Pages proxy instead:

```
https://newtab@sssstf0rest.github.io/…/redirect.html?url=<encoded original>
```

`REDIRECT_PAGE_BASE` is served from [docs/redirect.html](docs/redirect.html) via GitHub Pages. **The constant and the deployed page are coupled** — changing one without the other silently breaks every Gmail/Outlook bookmark. `removePrefix` unwraps the `?url=` parameter back to the real URL, and `redirect.html` self-redirects after 1.5s so bookmarks still work when the extension is disabled. Cost: these bookmarks show the proxy's favicon, not the site's.

Adding a domain to this list only helps bookmarks created afterward — existing ones keep their old form until the extension is toggled off and on.

## Settings

Stored in **`chrome.storage.sync`** under key `"settings"` (not `local` — the privacy policy's "local storage" wording is stale):

- `enabled` (bool) — toggles bookmark prefixing and the DNR ruleset together
- `focusNewTab` (bool)
- `position` (`"end"` | `"right"`)

The popup talks to the worker through `getSettings` / `updateSettings` messages ([js/background.js:813](js/background.js:813)). A separate `storage.onChanged` listener ([js/background.js:841](js/background.js:841)) re-applies enable/disable when settings sync from another device — so a toggle can trigger a full bookmark rewrite without any local user action.

Popup language (`lang`, EN/ZH) is stored separately in `storage.sync`. Popup strings live in the `I18N` object in [js/popup.js](js/popup.js) and are applied to `[data-i18n]` elements; any new popup text needs both a `data-i18n` attribute and entries in **both** language maps.

## Key Constraints and Known Traps

- **Bookmark URLs are mutated in place.** Enable prefixes every http(s) bookmark; disable strips them. Chrome fires no pre-uninstall event, so uninstalling while enabled leaves prefixed URLs behind permanently.
- **`chrome.bookmarks.onChanged` can loop.** It only re-prefixes when the prefix is absent ([js/background.js:431](js/background.js:431)); removing that guard causes an infinite update cycle.
- **`DownloadItem` has no `tabId`** — the download listener can never identify its own tab. Fixed by URL-keyed dedup (see above); the old `downloadItem.tabId` check was dead code that duplicated a tab on every click. **Never guess the tab with `tabs.query({active:true})`** — that is why `openInNewTab` deliberately has no active-tab fallback ([js/background.js:475](js/background.js:475)). Guessing produced the duplicate when `focusNewTab` was off, and collapsed "Open all bookmarks" onto a single tab when it was on.
- **Reusing a tab requires `isReusableBlankTab`, not `isNewTabPage`.** `Tab.url` is `""` for anything not yet committed, so an empty url means *unknown*, not *blank*. `isReusableBlankTab` ([js/background.js:330](js/background.js:330)) consults `pendingUrl` and treats a tab loading our own `newtab@` marker as reusable — that case is load-bearing for "Open all bookmarks", where every fresh tab must navigate itself rather than get a second tab created for it. `isNewTabPage` keeps its permissive `!url → true` behaviour because `onCommitted`'s fallback still depends on it.
- **`downloads.setUiOptions` silently fails.** The call at [js/background.js:900](js/background.js:900) needs the `"downloads.ui"` permission, which the manifest does not declare — it rejects and is swallowed. Adding the permission also suppresses download UI profile-wide, which is why the newer architecture eliminates the download entirely instead.
- **Only `http(s)` URLs can carry the prefix.** `chrome://`, `edge://`, `about:`, `file://` bookmarks keep default behavior.
- **Media on the source page can still be interrupted.** Chrome begins tearing down the renderer before extension code runs; Spotify is the reliable reproducer. This is inherent to MV3 and was not solved on this branch.
- **Service worker keep-alive** is a 30s no-op alarm ([js/background.js:753](js/background.js:753)) — needed only because the downloads listener must be live; unreliable by design.
- **README drift:** the permissions table lists `scripting` and describes a `window.stop()` + `history.back()` fallback. Neither exists in the manifest or the code on this branch.
